# ServerBackdoor
Mock server backdoor for playing around with another python backdoor client tool I made. It binds itself to a network interface card and a specific port (6666) in this case, and then waits for client commands. Depending on the commands received it will return info to the client. This was made as a fun project to practice using python for a pentester course through INE.
